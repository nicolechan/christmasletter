                    Happy New Year 2018 and Happy Chinese New Year (Year of the Dog)! This photo was taken at El Nicho Waterfall in Central Cuba. We had a busy year of work, school, travel, fitness, family and dog. Read on for more about our year.

                	<strong>Arrow</strong><br>18 months old<br><br>
                	Our not-so-little puppy turned 1 this April! We celebrated with a birthday party and invited his 4-legged friends and their humans. Arrow is much more mellow than a year ago, but still loves to play fetch and takes walks twice a day with Patty and Tom. His newest activity this year was swimming in the backyard and playing fetch in the pool on hot summer afternoons. Now that the weather has cooled down, he only occasionally takes a dip, but Tom lets him off-leash by the river to run, play, and swim as puppies do.

                	​Two years out of college, I'm finally starting to get my footing on this "adult" thing. The biggest and best change for me has been focusing my free time only on things I love: traveling, spending time with friends, and lifting heavy objects for fun. Last year, I resolved to focus on my health, and I did just that; I ran my first half marathon and placed second in a team CrossFit/weightlifting competition. I cherish every minute of my New York City experience and couldn't be happier spending my 20s here.

                	2017 was a great year! I'm currently a sophomore at Santa Clara University and just recently declared an Economics major in the business school. I've been busy with school and am working hard to stay in shape through swim team. This year, I loved making new friends and getting to see the world during our trips to Maui, Cuba, and New York. One of the highlights of my year was volunteering as a camp counselor for <a href="http://donate.kesem.org/manatee18" target="_blank">Camp Kesem</a>, a nonprofit organization and summer camp dedicated to supporting kids whose parents have cancer. I'm so grateful for all the adventures I had and new friends I made in 2017, and can't wait to see what 2018 has in store!

                	2017 was a good year, filled with lots of love. Some of the highlights include practicing yoga in Thailand, appreciating Cuba's rich history, visiting Alex and New York City, shopping in Morocco, and marveling at Utah's majestic National Park landscapes. Daily life is spent exercising, working on General Produce's digital media, or cherishing moments with my 92-year old mom, puppy Arrow and the rest of the family.

                	Every year seems to go by more quickly. I'm blessed to still be in good health and surrounded by a loving and supportive family which includes Patty (my patient wife of 32 years) and two beautiful and capable daughters (Alex and Nicole) and extends to my 93-year old mother (May) and 92-year old mother-in-law (Amy) and to my sometimes crazy three sisters (Mimi, Marcia and Adrienne). I have a great business partner (Danny) which makes dealing with the everyday challenges of running a produce distribution business more bearable. I still travel for work and pleasure and can chill out at home with another love of my life, our golden retriever Arrow. I know that I have a good life.

                	<strong>Cuba</strong><br><em>July</em><br><br>
              		Here we are learning how to dance salsa in Trinidad, Cuba. Fortunately, we were able to travel to Cuba on an individual tour before you-know-who (the president) closed the doors again so only large sanctioned groups could visit the island. We designed our own itinerary (<a href="http://wijincuba.com/" target="_blank">wijincuba.com</a>) and got around with a guide and driver. Our accommodations were almost exclusively ​"​casa​s​ particular​es", which is their equivalent of Airbnb. We had few expectations about Cuba since we knew little about it. Our trip was a lesson in the colonial history of this tobacco and sugar producing Caribbean island which was Spain's front door to conquering Latin America. We also learned the reasons for its geopolitical significance post-independence. The country is definitely poor, but the culture is rich. The people we saw in the cities and countries were friendly and seemed relatively happy despite their lack of material wealth.

                	Tom and Patty had a great time exploring Morocco with friends. We loved venturing into the maze of stores in the souks (markets) with their exotic spices, homeopathic body treatments and artisan shoes, and peeking into doorways to see everyday life. We enjoyed understanding more about the rich Islamic and Berber cultures, visiting handicraft studios, sightseeing in Fes, Marrakech and Casablanca, savoring Morocco's delicious stews cooked in tagines (clay pots), and trekking the High Atlas mountains through remote villages.

                	Last year we visited Zion & Bryce National Parks and Escalante Staircase National Monument in Southern Utah. We were so mesmerized by the magnificence of the scenery that we went back to Utah again this year to visit Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. We were just as awed by the spectacular natural sights. This photo was taken at Double Arch in Arches National Park.
