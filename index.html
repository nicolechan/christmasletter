                <h2>Tom</h2>
                <p>2016 went by in a whirl. This year's trips involved hiking and outdoor adventure--from whitewater rafting in the frigid waters of Iceland to slicing through the slot canyons in Southern Utah. Tom is sure glad that he and Patty still have enough stamina and strength to keep up with their fit and nimble daughters. Their parents may be "old" but they're not THAT old. This photo is of Tom and his mother in Maui on her 92nd birthday. What a delight to have her in their lives. On the other end of the age spectrum, they are thrilled (they think) to have Arrow Jang Chan as the newest four-legged member of their family. Tom's biggest change in his daily routine is taking Arrow out for a walk every morning before he (Tom, not Arrow) goes to work.</p>

                <h2>Patty</h2>
                <p>Just as I thought I was becoming an empty nester, I embraced motherhood once more with my new four-legged child, Arrow. The year flew by fast training Arrow, managing the household, caring for my 91-year young mother, working part-time for General Produce and practicing yoga. Tom and I visited Zion and Bryce National Parks; this is a photo of hiking the "Narrows" where we forded the river through the stunning slot canyons of Utah.</p>

                <h2>Nicole</h2>
                18&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Clara, CA
                <p>2016 was a big year for Nicole! She finished her final semester of high school and graduated in May. She spent her post-grad summer swimming, working at General Produce, traveling, relaxing, and enjoying her final months at home with her parents, friends, and new puppy Arrow. After a long summer, Nicole started her first quarter at Santa Clara University in September. She quickly and happily adjusted to college life, living with her two amazing roommates, and exercising more independence. She is currently an undeclared business major and is getting involved at school through swim team and various clubs. She loves her classes, new friends, and exploring the Santa Clara/San Jose area, and can't wait to go back to school in the new year!</p>

                8 months old
                <p>Meet Arrow, our newest family member! We brought this golden retriever pup home in June from a breeder in Lodi, CA at just 8 weeks old! Patty has been busy training him and taking him to puppy classes. He loves snuggling up under kitchen chairs, playing fetch in the backyard, and going on walks twice a day with Patty and Tom!</p>
