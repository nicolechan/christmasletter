                <h2>What Empty Nesters?</h2>
                <p>Patty and Tom knew the day would come when they would be home alone without the girls. Alex has been away from home for over 5 years. Nicole just left for her first year of college in September. Are we now Empty Nesters? Not exactly. See below to find out why.</p>

                <h2>Iceland</h2>
                <p>Our big family trip this year was to Iceland. It was a complete outdoor adventure. We drove the relatively narrow two-lane roads across a large portion of the main island. The diversity of geography was remarkable. With 20 hours of daylight, we had spectacular views of mountains, fjords, waterfalls, volcanoes and geysers. The highlight for the girls (definitely NOT Patty) was rafting the whitewater of the frigid East Glacial River. The dry suits definitely kept us warm and dry but didn't prevent Patty from falling out of the raft a couple times and taking a fast swim downstream before being picked up by the rescue kayaker. Patty was fine. Needless to say, Patty's rafting days are over. In this photo, that's Tom and Alex in the front. Patty is behind Alex...still in the raft!</p>

                <h2>Tom</h2>
                <p>2016 went by in a whirl. This year's trips involved hiking and outdoor adventure--from whitewater rafting in the frigid waters of Iceland to slicing through the slot canyons in Southern Utah. I am sure glad that Patty and I still have enough stamina and strength to keep up with our fit and nimble daughters. We may be "old" but they're not THAT old. This photo is of me with my mother in Maui on her 92nd birthday. What a delight to have her in our lives. On the other end of the age spectrum, I am thrilled (Patty maybe less so) to have Arrow Jang Chan as the newest four-legged member of our family. The biggest change in my daily routine is taking Arrow out for a walk every morning before I (not Arrow) go to work.</p>

                <h2>Patty</h2>
                <p>Just as I thought I was becoming an empty-nester,  I embraced motherhood once more with our new four-legged child, Arrow. The year flew by fast seeing Nicole through her Senior year of high school, training Arrow, managing the household and family trips, caring for my 91-year young mother, working for General Produce and practicing yoga. Tom and I visited Zion and Bryce National Parks in November. This is a photo of hiking "The Narrows" where we forded the river through the stunning slot canyons of Utah. I was struck by the reminder that although we travel the world over to see the beautiful, unparallelled beauty is right in our own backyard of the U.S.A.</p>

                <h2>Alex</h2>
                23&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York, NY
                <p>After a brief stint playing rugby post-college, I decided to expand my horizons outside of work. So rather than getting tackled for fun, I joined a CrossFit gym, which involves lifting a lot of heavy weights and doing pushups in a handstand position â€“ basically the equivalent of exercise masochism. I love my life in NYC, both as a young professional working in loyalty marketing and as a California transplant navigating the urban jungle. I call Manhattan home now, but my heart will always remain rooted with my family in Sacramento.</p>

                18&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Clara, CA
                <p>2016 was a big year for me! I finished my final semester of high school and graduated in May. After spending my post-grad summer swimming, working at General Produce, traveling, relaxing, and enjoying my final months at home with my parents, friends, and new puppy Arrow, I started my first quarter at Santa Clara University in September. I quickly and happily adjusted to college life and exercising more independence. I'm currently in the business school and having a great time getting involved at school through swim team and various clubs. I love my classes, new friends, and exploring the Santa Clara area, and can't wait to go back to school in the new year!</p>

                8 months old
                <p>Meet Arrow, our newest family member! We brought this golden retriever pup home in June from a breeder in Lodi, CA at just 8 weeks old! Patty has been busy training him and taking him to puppy classes. He loves snuggling up under kitchen chairs, playing fetch in the backyard, and going on walks twice a day with Patty and Tom!</p>
